Display Data in SQL Server
==========================
 
> "SELECT" command is used to display data from the table.

 syn: SELECT <col/*> FROM <tabname>; // this whole statement is called querry or command and SELECT and FROM  are called clauses

 SQL = English
 QUERIES = Sentences
 CLAUSES = Words

 FROM clause -> specify tablename
 SELECT clause -> specify column names
 * -> all columns

> Display employee names and salaries/hiredate/dno
 SELECT ENAME,SAL FROM EMP
 SELECT ENAME,HIREDATE FROM EMP
 SELECT ENAME,DNO FROM EMP

>Display all the data from EMP
 SELECT * FROM EMP //shows all the data

>WHERE caluse: ( Display specific )
===============
 Used to access specific row/rows based on a condition

 SELECT columns
 FROM tabname
 WHERE condition

 conditions: ( made of relational operators )
  COLNAME OP VALUE
   > OP is any relational operator like > >= < <= = <>
   > if cond is true row is selected
   > if cond is false row is not selected
 Examples:
 ---------
  Display employee details whose id = 102
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMPID=102 // goes every row and checks true or false and shows all the datails because '*'
  > SELECT ENAME FROM EMP WHERE EMPID=102 //only name will be shown here 
  Display employee details whose name = 'Kumar'
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = 'Kumar' // '' mandatory to display sting
  Display employee details who earn more then 5000
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL > 5000
  Display employees joined after 2020
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE > 2020 // date is incompatable with number
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE > '2020-12-31' // Hiredate date type is compated with '2020-12-31' which is also date type
  Display employees joined before 2020
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE < '2020-01-01'
  Display employees not working for Dno 10
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE DNO <> 10

Adding multiple condtions to single querry
Compound condtion:
==================
 Multilple condtions combined with AND / OR operators is called compound condtion.
 > WHERE COND1 AND/OR COND2 
 Examples:
 ---------
  > WHERE CATEGORY = 'MOBILES' AND PRICE < 20000 // only mobiles under 20000
  > WHERE CATEGORY = 'MOBILES' OR PRICE < 20000 // any product that is under 20000, satisfying one condtion is enough
  Display Employee details whose id = 100, 103, 105
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE EMPID = 100 OR EMPID = 103 OR EMPID = 105
  Display employees working as clerk, analyst
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB = 'CLERK' OR JOB = 'ANALYST'
  Display employees working as analyst beloging to 20th Dept
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB = 'ANALYST' AND DNO = '20'
  Display employees earning >5000 and <10000
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE SAL > 5000 AND SAL < 10000
  Display employees joined in 2020
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE HIREDATE >= '2020-01-01' AND HIREDATE <= '2020-12-31'
  Display employees working as clerk, analyst and earning more than 5000
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE JOB = 'CLERK' OR JOB = 'ANALYST' AND SAL > 5000 // here JOB = 'ANALYST' AND SAL = 5000 are compared first i.e AND is prioritized and then it'll compare with JOB = 'CLERK'
  > SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE ( JOB = 'CLERK' OR JOB = 'ANALYST' ) AND SAL > 5000 // () to force comparision
